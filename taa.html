    <h1 class="flicker">The Abandoned Asylum: "The Forgotten Ward"</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In the outskirts of the city, long after the patients were transferred, the old Brackenwood Asylum sat forgotten. Its crumbling walls and shattered windows had been left to the mercy of time, and few dared to approach it. The asylum had once been a place for those deemed too dangerous or insane to be in society, and over the years, rumors had spread about the dark experiments that were conducted there unnatural things that drove the patients to madness.</p>

    <p>One night, a group of curious teenagers, eager for a thrill, decided to break in. They snuck through the broken gate, their flashlights flickering in the darkness as they made their way inside. The air smelled of decay, and the walls were covered in old, peeling paint. Their footsteps echoed in the vast, empty halls.</p>

    <p>As they explored, they came across a room labeled "Ward 13." The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit corridor with old, rusted beds lined up against the walls. The air was thick, and the faint scent of something metallic lingered. It felt wrong, but they pushed forward.</p>

    <p>Then, the door slammed shut behind them.</p>

    <p>They turned, but there was no one there. The room was silent.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a loud bang echoed from the end of the hall. The group spun around, heartbeats racing. The sound grew closer a heavy, dragging sound, like something scraping against the floor.</p>

    <p>“Guys, we need to get out of here,” one of them, Sarah, whispered, panic rising in her voice.</p>

    <p>But before they could leave, the lights flickered. A figure appeared in the doorway pale, gaunt, with hollow eyes. It wore an old hospital gown, stained with dark marks.</p>

    <p>The figure reached out, its hand twitching as if beckoning them forward. “Stay with me,” it rasped.</p>

    <p>One by one, the teenagers froze. They were too terrified to move, too shocked to speak.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps filled the hallway slow, deliberate. More figures emerged from the shadows, all dressed in tattered gowns, their faces twisted in silent screams. They moved toward the group, dragging their feet across the floor with unnerving precision.</p>

    <p>Sarah screamed, her voice echoing through the asylum. The others followed, running for the exit as the asylum seemed to come alive around them. The walls shifted, the floors groaned underfoot. Every corner they turned led them deeper into the labyrinth of the abandoned asylum.</p>

    <p>When they finally burst through the front doors, gasping for breath, the asylum was still. Silent.</p>

    <p>As they left, one of them, looking back, saw a single figure standing in the doorway, watching them. Its hollow eyes locked with theirs, a smile creeping across its face.</p>

    <p>The group never spoke of what happened that night, but every so often, Sarah would wake up in the middle of the night, hearing the dragging footsteps of the patients… just outside her door.</p>
