    <div id="scare" class="hidden-scare">BOO! 🎃</div>

    <p>When Emily and her cousin Daniel decided to hike into the Blackthorn Forest, they knew the legends. Old stories told of the forest being cursed, of people who entered and were never seen again. It was said that the trees were alive, their branches whispering in the wind, calling travelers deeper into their dark heart.</p>

    <p>But Emily and Daniel were skeptics, dismissing the tales as mere superstition. They packed their bags and set off on the winding trail, the sun barely breaking through the thick canopy above. They had no idea that they were being watched.</p>

    <p>As they ventured deeper, the trees grew taller, and the light grew dimmer. A strange silence surrounded them no birds chirped, no leaves rustled. Then, they heard it the whispers.</p>

    <p>At first, they thought it was the wind, but the voices became clearer. “Go back,” a voice whispered, cold and distant. “Leave now…”</p>

    <p>Daniel stopped in his tracks. “Did you hear that?”</p>

    <p>Emily nodded, her heart racing. “Yeah, but there’s no one here…”</p>

    <p>The whispers grew louder, now sounding like voices some pleading, others laughing maniacally. The trees around them seemed to lean closer, their branches twisting into unnatural shapes.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a figure appeared before them. It was tall, covered in moss and leaves, with hollow eyes that seemed to pierce through the very air. The ground beneath them trembled as the figure pointed toward a dark, gaping hole in the forest floor.</p>

    <p>“Your souls belong to the forest now,” it whispered, its voice echoing in their minds.</p>

    <p>Emily grabbed Daniel’s arm, pulling him away. They ran, but no matter how fast they went, the forest seemed to stretch on forever. The whispers surrounded them, growing louder, filling their ears with a cacophony of voices.</p>

    <p>They finally burst into the clearing where the trail started, breathless and shaken. Behind them, the trees stood still once more, silent as the grave. When they looked back, the hole was gone, and the figure had vanished.</p>

    <p>Neither of them spoke much about what happened, but every year, on the anniversary of their hike, Emily swears she hears the whispers calling her name from deep within the forest.</p>
